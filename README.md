# amplicon_snp_finder
A tool to find the minimal number of primer pairs required to cover a list of snps when given a primer bed file. Initially desgined to work for Monkeypox Virus amplicon based primer schemes, this will work with any amplicon based primer scheme suh as the ARTIC SARS-CoV-2 schemes.

This tool can take a json file of lineage defining mutations constructed like the Moneypox lineage.json (https://github.com/mpxv-lineages/lineage-designation/blob/master/auto-generated/lineages.json) and/or a csv of SNP positions and the lineage they define. It then compares this to a provided bed file of primer amplicon positions and returns a tsv of the primers that cover all SNPs in the CSV/json provided, as we as the minimal amplicon list to cover all SNPs for the lineages of interest, and finally the minimal list of amplicons that contian SNPs to differentiate all lineages of interest.
